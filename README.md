Rock tunnel
-----------

The rock tunel is a natural tunnel found in the route 10, in Kanto.
Even though it can look small at a first sight, there is a secret staircase
leading to a much bigger dungeon below.

You are Pikachu, and are trapped inside.


How to play
-----------

You can run the game using:

    ./r.py

It needs python3 with curses support (so no Windows, afaik)
